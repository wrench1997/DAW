//! Batteries-included audio playback: drive a [`Plugin`] from an [`AudioBackend`].
//!
//! This is the glue that turns a loaded plugin into sound. [`play_with_backend`]
//! opens the backend's default output device and pumps the plugin's
//! [`Plugin::process_audio`] from the device callback, returning an [`AudioHandle`]
//! that keeps the stream alive and lets you keep controlling the plugin (send MIDI,
//! change parameters) while it plays.
//!
//! For the common case, prefer [`crate::simple::play`] or [`crate::Vst3Host::play`].
