//! Lock-free real-time plugin runner.
//!
//! [`Vst3Host::play`](crate::Vst3Host::play) / [`simple::play`](crate::simple::play) are the
//! friendly path: they wrap the plugin in an `Arc<Mutex<Plugin>>` and the audio callback
//! locks it. That's correctness-first but not hard-real-time — a control-thread call can
//! contend with the audio thread for the lock.
//!
//! [`RealtimePluginRunner`] is the serious path *alongside* it. The runner **owns** the
//! plugin on the audio thread; control commands (MIDI, parameter changes) are delivered over
//! a lock-free SPSC ring and applied at the start of each block. The audio callback never
//! takes a lock a control thread could be holding, so it can't be blocked by `set_parameter`
//! or `send_midi`.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use vst3_host::{simple, realtime::RealtimePluginRunner, midi::MidiChannel, audio::AudioBuffers};
//! # fn main() -> vst3_host::Result<()> {
//! let plugin = simple::load_plugin("/path/synth.vst3")?;
//! let (mut runner, mut control) = RealtimePluginRunner::new(plugin, 1024);
//! runner.start()?;
//!
//! // From any thread: queue control changes without locking the audio thread.
//! control.send_midi(vst3_host::midi::MidiEvent::NoteOn { channel: MidiChannel::Ch1, note: 60, velocity: 100 });
//!
//! // On the audio thread (e.g. your device callback): drain commands + render, no locks.
//! let mut buffers = AudioBuffers::new(0, 2, 512, 48_000.0);
//! runner.process(&mut buffers)?;
//!
//! // Stop the audio side, then perform thread-affine COM teardown here.
//! runner.stop()?;
//! drop(runner);
