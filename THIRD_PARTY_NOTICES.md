# 第三方软件声明

适用版本：Citrus Studio 0.4.0，Windows 10/11 x64 发布包  
更新日期：2026-08-09

## 范围和使用说明

Citrus Studio 自有代码按仓库根目录 [LICENSE](LICENSE) 中的 MIT License 发布。

本文件记录当前 Windows x64 发布包直接随附的第三方二进制、vendored 源码，以及主要 Rust 依赖的来源和其 Cargo manifest 声明的许可证表达式。它是发布工程记录，不是法律意见，也不能替代组织自己的开源合规审查。Cargo.lock、编译目标、feature 或工具链发生变化后，发布负责人必须重新生成依赖清单并复核许可证文件。

VST2/VST3 插件由用户自行安装和加载。发布包不应包含任何第三方插件、插件预设、厂商 SDK、用户项目、录音或插件扫描缓存。

## 发布包内的直接组件

| 随附文件 | 来源 | 版本或基线 | 许可证 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| vst3-host-helper.exe | [rust-vst3-host](https://github.com/HelgeSverre/rust-vst3-host/tree/v0.9.0) 官方 process-isolation helper，vendored 于 src/bin/vst3-host-helper.rs | vst3-host 0.9.0 | MIT |
| libunwind.dll | [LLVM libunwind](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/llvmorg-22.1.8/libunwind)，来自 [llvm-mingw 20260616](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/releases/tag/20260616) | LLVM 22.1.8 | Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception |
| MinGW-w64 runtime 目标代码 | 由 llvm-mingw 的 x86_64-w64-windows-gnu/UCRT 链接过程嵌入两个 EXE | llvm-mingw 20260616 所带版本 | 见本文件末尾 MinGW-w64 runtime notices |

llvm-mingw 工具链本身不进入发布 ZIP；发布 ZIP 只携带由它生成的 EXE 和与其匹配的 libunwind.dll。libunwind.dll 必须与两个 EXE 位于同一目录。

## Rust 工具链

当前已验证构建使用：

| 组件 | 版本 | 来源 | 许可证 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rust 标准库和运行时 | rustc 1.97.1，commit 8bab26f4f68e0e26f0bb7960be334d5b520ea452c | [rust-lang/rust 1.97.1](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/1.97.1) | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |
| Cargo | 1.97.1，commit c980f4866141969fab6254a680546a277789d6f0 | [rust-lang/cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |

Cargo 和编译器是构建输入，不作为独立程序随包分发。Rust 标准库及编译器运行时的相关目标代码可能静态进入 EXE，因此发布审计仍应保留 Rust 的许可证来源记录。

## 主要直接 Cargo 依赖

当前 Windows x64、all-features 的 Cargo metadata 解析结果包含本项目加 232 个第三方 package。传递依赖中除 MIT/Apache-2.0 组合外，还出现 Unicode-3.0、Zlib、BSD-2-Clause、BSD-3-Clause、ISC、BSL-1.0、CC0-1.0、MPL-2.0、Unlicense、OFL-1.1 和 Ubuntu-font-1.0 等表达式。特别需要关注：

- epaint_default_fonts 0.35.0：代码为 MIT OR Apache-2.0，内置字体另含 OFL-1.1 和 Ubuntu-font-1.0。
- ICU4X/Unicode 相关 crate：Unicode-3.0。
- option-ext 0.2.0：MPL-2.0。
- clipboard-win 5.4.1 与 error-code 3.3.2：BSL-1.0。
- self_cell 1.3.0：Apache-2.0 OR GPL-2.0-only；此处只记录上游表达式，不声称已选择 GPL 选项。
- libloading 0.7.4/0.8.9：ISC。
- walkdir、same-file 及若干 BurntSushi crate：Unlicense/MIT 或 Unlicense OR MIT。

完整、机器可读的当前依赖集合应从 Cargo.lock 和 Cargo metadata 生成，而不是手工维护：

    cargo +1.97.1-x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm metadata --locked --all-features --filter-platform x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm --format-version 1

发布负责人应保存该 JSON 作为构建记录，并从每个 package 的 license、license_file、repository 和 source 字段生成完整归档。若自动审计和本文件不一致，应停止发布并先更新本文件。

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
    
        1. Definitions.
    
          "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
          and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
    
          "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
          the copyright owner that is granting the License.
    
          "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
          other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
          control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
          "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
          direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
          otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
          outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
    
          "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
          exercising permissions granted by this License.
    
          "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
          including but not limited to software source code, documentation
          source, and configuration files.
    
          "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
          transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
          not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
          and conversions to other media types.
    
          "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
          Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
          copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
          (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
    
          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
          form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
          editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
          represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
          of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
          separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
          the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
    
          "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
          the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
          to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
          submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
          or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
          the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
          means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
          to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
          communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
          and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
          Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
          excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
          designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
    
          "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
          on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
          subsequently incorporated within the Work.
    
        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
          publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
          Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
    
        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
          by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
          Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
          as of the date such litigation is filed.
    
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
          Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
          modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
          meet the following conditions:
    
          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
              Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
    
          (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that You changed the files; and
    
          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
              attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
              the Derivative Works; and
    
          (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
              as modifying the License.
    
          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
          the conditions stated in this License.
    
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
    
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
    
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
    
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
    
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
    
          To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
          boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
          replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
          the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
          comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
          file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
          same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
          identification within third-party archives.

    FIXME: Cephes math lib
    Copyright (C) 1984-1998 Stephen L. Moshier
    
    It sounds vague, but as to be found at
    <http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00295.html>, it gives an
    impression that the author could be willing to give an explicit
    permission to distribute those files e.g. under a BSD style license. So
    probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a
    permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files
    in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the
    version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming
    from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.
